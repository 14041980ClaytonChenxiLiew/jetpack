# Jetpack Changelogger

This is tool allowing for managing a changelog for your project by having each PR drop a
specially-formatted "change file" into a `changelog` directory, which the tool can then process when
you make a release.

## Installation

Require using `composer require --dev automattic/jetpack-changelogger`.

This will install the `changelogger` tool into `vendor/bin/`, which you might add to your PATH, or
you might run it via `composer exec -- changelogger`.

If you're using `git`, it's recommended to also create `changelog/.gitkeep` in your repository so
the directory will always be present.

## Configuration

Changelogger is configured via entries in composer.json, under `extra.changelogger`. In most cases
you can set the configuration using `composer config extra.changelogger.$setting $value`.

- **changes-dir**: Specifies the directory holding changes files, relative to the composer.json. Default is `changelog`.
- **types**: Specifies the types of changes used in the repository; see [Type field](#type-field). The
  value is a JSON object, with keys being the field value in the change file and values being the
  subheading text used in the combined changelog file. May be empty; the default is to use the types
  listed at https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/#types.
- **versioning**: Versioning method used to determine new versions. Two methods are included by default:
  - **semver**: [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
  - **wordpress**: WordPress, and some of its plugins such as Jetpack, give normal releases decimal
    version numbers such as 9.4, incrementing it by 0.1 with each release. There is no special
    significance to going from 8.9 to 9.0. Bugfix "point releases" add a suffix like 9.4.1.

## Usage

### Adding a change file

The changelog file consists of named fileds, a blank line, and the changelog entry content.

```
Significance: major
Type: added
Comment: This is an example.

Initial commit!
```

The filename in the `changelog` directory does not matter, as long as it does not begin with a dot.

A changelog file may be created interactively using `changelogger add`. You may also specify all the
needed fields non-interactively with command line options; see `changelogger add --help` for details.

#### Significance field

This field specifies the significance of the change in the style of [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
Valid values are

- **patch**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes.
- **minor**: Added (or deprecated) functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.
- **major**: Broke backwards compatibility in some way.

Depending on the `versioning` [configuration setting](#configuration), this may be used to determine
the version when rolling the change files into a new changelog version.

#### Type field

This specifies the type of the change, which in turn is used to place the entry in a proper
subheading when rolling the change files into a new changelog version.

Valid types are defined in the `types` [configuration setting](#configuration). If that setting is
empty, the Type field should be omitted.

#### Comment field

This field contains arbitrary text that might be useful in communicating to other developers. It is
not used by Changelogger.

#### Changelog entry

The changelog entry comes after all the fields, separated from them by a blank line. This is the
text that is included in the changelog file when the change files are combined into a changelog
version.

When the [significance](#significance-field) is "patch", the entry may be left empty. It is not
valid to leave it empty when the significance is "minor" or "major".
